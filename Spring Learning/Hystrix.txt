Hystrix
1. This library is developed by Netflix that is used in spring cloud to handle failures in a distributed system.
2. It is a latency and fault tolerance library.
3. Helps in preventing cascading failures and provide fallback mechanisms when a service call fails.
4. It can be used in situations where your application depends on remote services
5. Provide callback methods

Key features -
1. Circuit Breaker
2. Timeout Handling
3. Fallback Mechanism
4. Bulkhead Pattern
5. Monitoring & Metrics

Hystrix Dashboard
1. Allows you to monitor Hystrix metric in real time

We have to use annotation 
@EnableHystrix in project in which we will use hystrix
@EnableHystrixDashboard in hystrix service
Also add dependencies

But from Spring 3.0 hystrix is no longer in use and instead of it we use Resilience4j for circuit breaker and more.
